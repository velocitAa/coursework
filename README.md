Hello there! Welcome to GitHub recommendation system repository.

### Overview
The system performance solves several types of machine learning tasks: classification, recognition and unsupervised learning. For this tasks was used computer vision technologies, transformers and metric models (RandomForestClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier an etc.). The logging of models was produced by Wandb, plotting of data presentation by plotly

### Features
- Recommendations based on song features
- Songs classifiaction by genre and by mood
- Songs recognition by hash of spectogramm's peaks and cosine similarity
- Gradio interface which help to see performance of recommendation system 

### Getting Started
To start using recommendation system, simply clone this repository to your local machine. Make sure to have the necessary dependencies installed from 'requirements.txt' before running the system. After this go to "api" folder and run gradio_interface.py 

### Usage
